# Facebook Messenger Watson Recipe Bot
This is a Python Flask web application that serves as a webhook for a Facebook Messenger chatbot.

The app responds to GET requests as well as incoming messages from Facebook via POST. It uses:
 - IBM Watsonâ„¢ Conversation service to extract intent and entities as well as navigate through a dialog.
 - Cloudant NoSQL DB to store user context for future reference in the conversation
 - Spoonacular API to return recipe suggestions and steps based on user input
